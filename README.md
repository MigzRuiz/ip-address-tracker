## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React JS
- SASS
- Leaflet API and Geolocation API
- Netlify

### What I learned

I learned a lot on this project. I've learned to build a react app from scratch. I've also reinforced my knowledge in JS and React JS. I had some issues with the leaflet js react because of their documentation. 

### Continued development

In the future, I'd like to fix the following:
- Adapt multiple screen sizes
- Input validation for the IP address
- Change the map layout
- Implement React Hooks or do Redux for state
